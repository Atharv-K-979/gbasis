## Why GBasis?
GBasis is a pure-Python package for evaluating and analytically integrating Gaussian-type orbitals and their related quantities. The goal is to build a set of tools to the quantum chemistry community that are easily accessible and easy to use as to facilitate future scientific works.

Since basis set manipulation is often slow, Quantum Chemistry packages in Python often interface to a lower-level lanaguage, such as C++ and Fortran, for these parts, resulting in a more difficult build process and limited distribution. The hope is that gbasis can fill in this gap without a significant difference in performance.
